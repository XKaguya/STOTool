# STO-Tool

A tool for checking the server status of Star Trek Online.

**This application is designed for a 2K resolution screen.**

**Due to the background image, this limitation is inevitable.**

**This means that the application only works for 2K screens. Neither 1K nor 4K resolutions are supported, and there are no plans to fix this right now.**
